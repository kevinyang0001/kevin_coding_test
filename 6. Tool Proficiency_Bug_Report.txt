1. Issue Type: Bug
2. Summary: User Registration Allows Duplicate Accounts (High Severity)

2. Description: This bug allows users to register for multiple accounts with the same username and email address. This creates a security risk and breaks data integrity.

3. Steps to Reproduce:
- Open a web browser and navigate to http://13.209.85.69/
- Click on the "Register" or "Sign Up" link.
- Enter the following information in the registration form:
- Username: Existing Username (e.g., qa_account_001)
- Email: Existing Email Address (e.g., qa_account_001@gmail.com) - Already associated with an existing account
- Password: This can be any valid password (e.g., Password123!)
- Re-enter Password (if applicable)
- Any other required information for registration
- Submit the registration form.
- Expected Result: The registration process should fail, and the user should be presented with an error message indicating that the username or email address is already registered.
- Actual Result: The registration process is successful, and a new account is created with the duplicate username and email address.
- Priority: High (This bug is a high security risk and should be addressed immediately)
- Attachments: video_duplicate_registration.mp4 (Attach the video demonstrating the bug)

4. Additional Notes: We need to implement validation logic on BE side to prevent duplicate user registrations based on username and email. This bug report outlines a critical issue in the user registration process. 
We would like to address this promptly as it is crucial for maintaining a secure and reliable user account system.
