[Scenario]
During a release cycle, you find that the number of bugs reported in the new
features is significantly higher than in the previous releases. The development team claims that
the features were developed according to specifications.

[Task]
A high number of bugs in new release compared to previous releases requires a root cause analysis to identify the root cause and prevent future occurrences, I would like to approach

1. Gather Information through,
- Bug Reports: Analyze the bug reports for the new features. Look for patterns in the types of bugs, affected functionalities, and specific areas within the code.
- QA Process review: Review the QA process for the new features. Check if there were any deviations from standard practices in integration testing or TC management.
- Communication: Meet with the development team to understand their perspective. Discuss if they encountered any challenges during development, and how they addressed them.

2. Root Cause Analysis based on the information collected,
- Reproducibility: Can QA reproduce issues? if then run through tests with various environmental chracteristics and then to improve its TCs
- Testing Coverage: Do we have TCs ready and execution records available? if not let's add them

3. Address the Issues by
- Improve Testing Coverage: If testing gaps are identified, implement them and consider additional test cases, exploratory testing, or automated testing to cover edge cases.
- Simplify TCs: Break down complex TCs into smaller, more manageable size.
- Improve Communication: Clear communication channels between development teams, QA.

Eventually, we can organize training session and share the knowledge bases within team, so that everyone in the team follows the standard and to improve the process over and over
